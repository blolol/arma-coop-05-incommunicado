OPFOR has probably left behind a couple of junkers during their sweep across the island.%1Finally, satellite imagery suggests OPFOR is restoring some BLUFOR equipment at several well-guarded military bases around the island -- probably captured during our failed assault in the spring. If you happen across any of our lost toys... you know what to do.</English>
